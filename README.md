THE LANGUAGE GAME
---

Welcome,

The language game is a pyhton terminal game, which runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku.

The purpose of this game is learning while playing, the user will chose the language they want to play with
and they will have to translate to english (EN) some random words they will be given.

The game consist in 10 questions and every correct answer the user will earn a point.

### Future features

- More Laguages to learn
- Dificult choice levels 


## Data Model

### Global Variables:

* answer: input to start or skip the quiz.
* score: A global variable to keep track of the player's score.
* total_questions: The total number of questions in the quiz.
* words: List of words loaded depending on the language.
* word: A randomly chosen word from the list of words.

### Functions:

* search_spanish_words(file_name): Reads words from a file in Spanish.
* search_french_words(file_name): Reads words from a file in French.
* choose_language(): Asks the user to choose a language.

* end_game(): Displays the final score and asks if the player wants to restart or exit.

### Google Translate API:

* translator: An instance of the Google Translate API for translating words.


## Testing

- I have mannually test the full game
- Generating invalid inputs and checking the performance of the game
- Everything works as it should.

- The code was check by a PEP8 linter

## Bugs

### Soved bugs

- There where words that appears more than once in each game, I fixed by creating an external list of the same words in where every time a word appears its pop() out if the list so the issue didnt continue.

- After restarting the game the scores continue as the last game, I fixed this by simply start the game loop function checkig the global score that by default was 0.

### Remaining bugs

- No remaining bugs.

### Validator testing

- [PEP8](https://www.pythonchecker.com/)


## Deployment

- This proyect was deployed using Code Institute's mock terminal on Heroku.

- Steps for deployment:

- Following Code Institute tutorials,
    
    * Create a new Heroku app
    * Chose deploment method: Heroku Git, GitHub or Container Registry
    * In this case we used GitHub, so we simply connect it to the gitHub account
    * Link the Heroku app to repository
    * Then go to App connected to GitHub and connect it to your repository using the repository name.
        * Clone: Cloning a repository means making a copy of an existing repository to your local machine.
        * Fork: Forking a repository on GitHub is a way to create a copy of someone else's repository under your GitHub account. This copy is still hosted on GitHub.
    * Set buildbacks to Python and NodeJS in that order
    * Config Vars to PORT 8000
    * Click on Deploy
        * Manual Deploys, you can create an immediate deployment of any branch from the GitHub repo thatâ€™s connected to your app. Use manual deploys if you want to control when changes are deployed to Heroku.
        * Automatic Deloys. When you enable automatic deploys for a GitHub branch, Heroku builds and deploys all pushes to that branch.
    
Deploying to Heroku involves taking your code and hosting it on Heroku's platform. This is typically done by pushing your code to a Heroku remote repository.
